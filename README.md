## About BanyanFoundry

**BanyanFoundry** is a learning space built on strong fundamentals, real-world practice, and slow, meaningful growth.

We believe great engineers are not created by shortcuts or certificates, but by deeply understanding the basics and applying them consistently in real scenarios.

At BanyanFoundry, learning happens through hands-on work, open repositories, practical assignments, and continuous feedback — just like real engineering teams work in the industry.

- 🌱 Strong foundations matter more than speed  
- 🧠 Understanding over memorization  
- 🛠️ Learning by doing real work  
- 🔍 Transparency over closed systems  
- 📚 Growth mindset over exam mindset  

We focus on **how things actually work in the real world**, not just how to finish a syllabus.
